# AppMan My Playlist 2020

I am a customer who want you to build a web application (both `frontend` and `backend`) about creating playlist (like spotify) with the following requirements: 

| User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|:---|:---|
|As a registered user, I am required to login so that I can access the application.|- I can login to the application.<br>- I can see the create button after logged in.|
|As a registered user, I want to see my playlist so that I can build a list of my song that I like.|- I can see the modal of creating playlist.<br/>-I can add the song to the playlist.<br/> - I can remove the song from the playlist.|
|As a registered user, I want to see random recommended song so that I can select the difference song.|- I can refresh the song to re-random the song list.<br/>- I can see the recommended songs only 5 songs per time.|
|As a registered user, I want to know how long of my playlist so that I can see the total duration of the playlist.|- I can see the total of the duration of the playlist.|


## Also, we already prepared some stuff for you!!! :D

### 1. Interface
- Use below mockup to create the web application
![Mockup_1](mockup/1_create_playlist.PNG)
![Mockup_2](mockup/2_manage_playlist.PNG)

### 2. Songs
- Use this data to be the initial data for backend side
[JSON of songs list](songs.json)

## Technical Requirements

- The application must separate `frontend` and `backend` into a different application

### `frontend`

- `frontend` application must be built by modern frontend JavaScript library / framework such as `React.js`, `Vue.js`, `Angular.js`, etc with concept of `SPA`

### `backend`

- `backend` application must be build by modern Node.js library such as `Express`, `Koa`, `Hapi`, `Loopback`, etc with concept of `RESTful API`
- `backend` application must connect with database
- Database can be SQL, NOSQL, etc
